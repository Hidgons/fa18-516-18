info:
  description: User profiles are used to store information about
    users. User information can be reused in other services. This is
    useful to access files and upload or download them to cloud
    machines.  Profiles can be added, removed and listed. A group in
    the profile can be used to augment users to be part of one or more
    groups.  A number of roles can specify a specific role of a user.
