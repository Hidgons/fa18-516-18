info:
  description: A file is a computer resource allowing storage of data that is
    being processed. The interface to a file provides the mechanism to
    appropriately locate a file in a distributed system. File
    identification includes the name, endpoint, checksum, and
    size. Additional parameters, such as the last access time, could
    also be stored. The interface only describes the location of the
    file.  The file object has name, endpoint (location), size in GB,
    MB, Byte, checksum for integrity check, and last accessed
    timestamp.
